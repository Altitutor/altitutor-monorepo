# StaffTable Refactoring Improvements

## Overview
The original `StaffTable.tsx` component (373 lines) was refactored to improve maintainability, performance, and follow React best practices. The component was broken down into smaller, focused components and custom hooks.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle Violations**
- **Before**: One large component handling data fetching, state management, filtering, sorting, and UI rendering
- **After**: Separated concerns into dedicated hooks and smaller components

### 2. **Performance Issues**
- **Before**: No memoization, filtering/sorting ran on every render
- **After**: Added `useMemo` for expensive operations, `useCallback` for event handlers, `React.memo` for components

### 3. **Complex State Management**
- **Before**: 11 separate `useState` hooks with complex interdependencies
- **After**: Consolidated related state into custom hooks with clear interfaces

### 4. **No Search Debouncing**
- **Before**: Search filter executed on every keystroke
- **After**: Added 300ms debounce to reduce unnecessary filtering operations

## New Architecture

### Custom Hooks

#### `useStaffData`
```typescript
interface UseStaffDataReturn {
  staffMembers: Staff[];
  staffClasses: Record<string, Class[]>;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  refreshData: () => Promise<void>;
}
```
- Handles all data fetching logic
- Manages loading and error states
- Provides clean refresh functionality

#### `useStaffFilters`
```typescript
interface UseStaffFiltersReturn {
  filteredStaff: Staff[];
  filters: StaffFilters;
  setSearchTerm: (term: string) => void;
  setRoleFilter: (role: StaffRole | 'ALL') => void;
  setStatusFilter: (status: StaffStatus | 'ALL') => void;
  handleSort: (field: keyof Staff) => void;
  resetFilters: () => void;
}
```
- Manages all filtering and sorting logic
- Uses `useMemo` for performance optimization
- Includes debounced search functionality

#### `useDebounce`
```typescript
function useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay: number): T
```
- Generic debounce hook for performance optimization
- Prevents excessive API calls and filtering operations

### Component Breakdown

#### `StaffTableFilters`
- Handles all filter UI controls
- Memoized with `React.memo`
- Clean prop interface for reusability

#### `StaffTableHeader`
- Manages table header with sorting functionality
- Memoized for performance
- Reusable sorting logic

#### `StaffTableRow`
- Individual row component
- Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Improved hover states and accessibility

## Performance Improvements

### 1. **Memoization**
- `React.memo` on all child components
- `useMemo` for filtered data computation
- `useCallback` for event handlers

### 2. **Debounced Search**
- 300ms delay prevents excessive filtering
- Significantly reduces computational overhead

### 3. **Optimized Re-renders**
- Components only re-render when their specific props change
- Reduced prop drilling through focused interfaces

### 4. **Better State Management**
- Related state grouped in custom hooks
- Cleaner dependencies and effects

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. **Type Safety**
- Strong TypeScript interfaces for all hooks and components
- Better prop validation and intellisense

### 2. **Error Handling**
- Improved error states and user feedback
- Better loading state management

### 3. **Accessibility**
- Better keyboard navigation
- Improved hover states and visual feedback

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Smaller, focused components (20-100 lines each)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test individual pieces

## File Structure
```
src/
├── hooks/
│   ├── useStaffData.ts          # Data fetching logic
│   ├── useStaffFilters.ts       # Filtering and sorting logic
│   ├── useDebounce.ts           # Generic debounce utility
│   └── index.ts                 # Hook exports
│
└── components/features/staff/
    ├── StaffTable.tsx           # Main component (reduced to 150 lines)
    ├── StaffTableFilters.tsx    # Filter controls
    ├── StaffTableHeader.tsx     # Table header with sorting
    └── StaffTableRow.tsx        # Individual row component
```

## Benefits

### For Developers
- **Easier to understand**: Each file has a single, clear purpose
- **Easier to test**: Small, focused units with clear interfaces
- **Easier to maintain**: Changes isolated to specific areas
- **Better reusability**: Hooks and components can be used elsewhere

### For Users
- **Better performance**: Faster filtering and rendering
- **Better UX**: Debounced search, improved loading states
- **More responsive**: Optimized re-rendering

### For the Codebase
- **Scalability**: Easier to add new features
- **Consistency**: Reusable patterns for other tables
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between concerns

## Usage Example

```typescript
// The main component is now much simpler and focused
export const StaffTable = memo(function StaffTable({ onRefresh }: StaffTableProps) {
  const { staffMembers, loading, error, refreshData } = useStaffData(onRefresh);
  const { filteredStaff, filters, ...filterActions } = useStaffFilters(staffMembers);
  
  // Component logic focuses only on UI coordination
  // Data and filtering logic handled by hooks
});
```

This refactoring demonstrates modern React patterns and best practices, resulting in a more maintainable, performant, and scalable codebase.
